# classification-models-for-a-wine-quality
The provided Python code focuses on building and evaluating classification models for a wine quality dataset. Here's a concise summary of the code:

Import Libraries:

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Load Dataset:

The wine quality dataset is loaded from the specified path, and basic information about the dataset is displayed using df.info().
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Rows with missing values are dropped.
A pairplot is created for visualizing relationships between features, with different colors indicating wine quality levels.
Feature Selection:

Features and the target variable ('quality') are selected.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Three classification models (RandomForestClassifier, SGDClassifier, and SVC) are trained and evaluated.
The data is split into training and testing sets, and each model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
Model performance metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are printed for each model.
In summary, this code demonstrates the process of training and evaluating classification models for predicting wine quality. It includes data exploration, cleaning, visualization, feature selection, and the training and evaluation of multiple classification models. The goal is to compare and analyze the performance of different algorithms on the given dataset.
